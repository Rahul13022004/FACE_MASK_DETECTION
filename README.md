# ðŸ˜· Face Mask Detection with Deep Learning

This project detects whether a person is wearing a face mask or not using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on the [Face Mask Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/omkargurav/face-mask-dataset).


## ðŸ§  Model Architecture

- Convolutional layers with ReLU activation
- MaxPooling layers
- Dense layers with Dropout
- Final layer with sigmoid activation for binary classification (mask / no mask)

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

- Sourced from Kaggle: [Face Mask Dataset by omkargurav](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/omkargurav/face-mask-dataset)
- Three folders: `Train`, `Validation`, `Test`
- Two classes: `with_mask`, `without_mask`

## ðŸš€ How to Use

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/face-mask-detection.git
cd face-mask-detection
